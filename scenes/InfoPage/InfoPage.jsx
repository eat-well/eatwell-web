            The Nutrimprove project is part of the NHS clinical entrepreneurship scheme and an initiative that aims to
            curate the world&apos;s largest database of nutritional recommendations with the help of UK-based registered
            nutritionists and dietitians.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant='body2' paragraph={true}>
            The NutrImprove web application will allow nutritionists, nutritional therapists and dietitians to recommend
            healthier alternatives to the foods that may not be adequate for optimal health.
            Recommendations will be stored in a database which will grow as more contributors join the project, feeding
            into a deeper and richer source of information for all users.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant='body2' paragraph={true}>
            The web application is constantly evolving and new functionalities will be added periodically. Contributors
            will have a first line of contact to provide any feedback or ideas on how to improve it.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant='body2' paragraph={true}>
            Contributors will also have access to all the accumulated recommendations data so they may quickly search
            and recommend healthier alternatives to their clients.
